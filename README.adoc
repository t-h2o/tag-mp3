= mp3 tag with name file

I recently downloaded with torrent the Bob Marley\'s discography and there is all metadata in the name file but not the mp3 file. My goal is to parse name file for tagging the mp3 files.

== Reasoning for ruilding my script

=== 1. Find a language

For this type of use (files manipulation), bash script is a good way.

=== 2. Collect data

=== 2.1 scanf

I know `scanf` from C language. You give a patter to `scanf` and he collectes data. I search something like scanf for bash script.

I found on https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/gxygww/why_isnt_there_scanf_or_equivalent_in_bash/[reddit] an example.

[source, bash]

#!/bin/bash

pattern="Fan: (.+) rpm CPU die temperature: (.+) C"
if [[ "Fan: fann rpm CPU die temperature: 42 C" =~ $pattern ]]; then
    fan=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}
    cpu=${BASH_REMATCH[2]}
fi
echo "$fan" "$cpu"

=== 2.2 A loop for each files

I need a loop for each files. I found an exmample on https://w3guides.com/tutorial/bash-for-each-file-in-folder#bash-for-each-file-in-folder[w3guides.com]

[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

for filename in ./*; do
	echo "${filename}"
done
